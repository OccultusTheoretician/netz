# KAOS KONTROL REPORT — 081615Z NOV 26

**KKR is the Kaos Kontrol Report** — the daily forecasting stage of the Prescient Desk. It reads the open-source collation, elicits falsifiable projections from a named forecaster arm, runs them through a mechanical gate that publishes its rejections with reasons, and seals what survives into the ledger before any outcome exists.

## II. REJECTED BY THE GATE — AUDIT TRAIL

- "The CISA KEV catalog carries a date-added value between 2026-11-08 and 2026-11-15 for a vulnerability with CVSS score 9.0 or higher." → REJECTED: cited items share no substantive vocabulary with the claim — a citation that does not support its entry makes the 4.02f priors unreadable and forces the keyed/keyless call to default; cite an item that grounds THIS claim
- "Reference: 4.86 percent on the packet date. The 10-year US Treasury yield closes above 5.00 percent on any weekday between 2026-11-16 and 20" → REJECTED: cited items share no substantive vocabulary with the claim — a citation that does not support its entry makes the 4.02f priors unreadable and forces the keyed/keyless call to default; cite an item that grounds THIS claim
- "A US federal court issues an indictment against a senior official of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for sanctions violations related " → REJECTED: cited items share no substantive vocabulary with the claim — a citation that does not support its entry makes the 4.02f priors unreadable and forces the keyed/keyless call to default; cite an item that grounds THIS claim
- "The S&P 500 index closes below 7,000 on any weekday between 2026-11-16 and 2026-11-20." → REJECTED: resolution names no source of record — a stranger must know exactly where to look on the deadline date
- "A cyberattack causes a disruption to a major US power grid that lasts more than 24 hours between 2026-11-08 and 2026-11-15." → REJECTED: cited items share no substantive vocabulary with the claim — a citation that does not support its entry makes the 4.02f priors unreadable and forces the keyed/keyless call to default; cite an item that grounds THIS claim; resolution names no source of record — a stranger must know exactly where to look on the deadline date
- "The European Central Bank cuts its main refinancing rate by 25 basis points or more between 2026-11-15 and 2026-11-22." → REJECTED: cited items share no substantive vocabulary with the claim — a citation that does not support its entry makes the 4.02f priors unreadable and forces the keyed/keyless call to default; cite an item that grounds THIS claim

## III. LEDGER STANDING

5468 issued all-time across 22 forecaster arms · 3746 open (1345 past deadline — run `python kkr.py --resolve`). **No pooled score is published** — a Brier score belongs to one forecaster; an average across arms is nobody's record.

**This arm — `lmstudio/qwen36-realist`:** 167 issued · 134 open · 31 resolved · 10 hits / 21 misses · **Brier 0.242** against its own base rate 32.3% (climatological 0.219) · **skill -0.106**.

*96 projection(s) voided — terminated as unadjudicable, never edited; each is itemised with its reason in [the ledger](ledger.html).*

**STANDING BY ARM** — segregated per RPAS 5.04; no pooled figure exists.
