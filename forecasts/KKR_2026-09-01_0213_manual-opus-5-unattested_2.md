# KAOS KONTROL REPORT — 010213Z SEP 26

**KKR is the Kaos Kontrol Report** — the daily forecasting stage of the Prescient Desk. It reads the open-source collation, elicits falsifiable projections from a named forecaster arm, runs them through a mechanical gate that publishes its rejections with reasons, and seals what survives into the ledger before any outcome exists.

Window: this run · source: battle_report_2026-08-31_1519.md · forecaster: manual/opus-5/unattested · 2 accepted / 0 rejected by validation gate · 2 rated below 35% (base-rate discipline)

## I. VALIDATED PROJECTIONS

| id | p | deadline | domain | statement | resolves on |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| KKR-20260901-02 | 22% | 2026-10-05 | political | A lapse in federal appropriations begins 2026-10-01 because no measure funding agencies past 2026-09-30 is enacted. | Congress.gov shows no continuing resolution or appropriations act funding federal agencies past 2026-09-30 signed into law on or before 2026-09-30. |
| KKR-20260901-03 | 25% | 2026-09-18 | economic | The FOMC raises the federal funds target range at its scheduled 2026-09-16 decision, above the current 3.50 to 3.75 percent. | The FOMC statement released 2026-09-16 sets a target range whose upper bound exceeds 3.75 percent. |

## II. REJECTED BY THE GATE — AUDIT TRAIL

Nothing rejected — every projection cleared the gate.

## III. LEDGER STANDING

1218 issued all-time across 14 forecaster arms · 1057 open (99 past deadline — run `python kkr.py --resolve`). **No pooled score is published** — a Brier score belongs to one forecaster; an average across arms is nobody's record.

**This arm — `manual/opus-5/unattested`:** 153 issued · 150 open · 3 resolved · 1 hits / 2 misses · **Brier 0.141** against its own base rate 33.3% (climatological 0.222) · **skill +0.366** · under 30 resolved, this is noise.

*13 projection(s) voided — terminated as unadjudicable, never edited; each is itemised with its reason in [the ledger](ledger.html).*

**STANDING BY ARM** — segregated per RPAS 5.04; no pooled figure exists.
