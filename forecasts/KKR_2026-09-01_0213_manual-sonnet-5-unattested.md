# KAOS KONTROL REPORT — 010213Z SEP 26

**KKR is the Kaos Kontrol Report** — the daily forecasting stage of the Prescient Desk. It reads the open-source collation, elicits falsifiable projections from a named forecaster arm, runs them through a mechanical gate that publishes its rejections with reasons, and seals what survives into the ledger before any outcome exists.

Window: this run · source: battle_report_2026-08-31_1519.md · forecaster: manual/sonnet-5/unattested · 2 accepted / 0 rejected by validation gate · 1 rated below 35% (base-rate discipline)

## I. VALIDATED PROJECTIONS

| id | p | deadline | domain | statement | resolves on |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| KKR-20260901-04 | 78% | 2026-09-16 | cyber | The CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog records 3 or more entries with dateAdded between 2026-09-01 and 2026-09-14. | Resolves true if the published CISA KEV catalog feed shows 3 or more entries with dateAdded in the window when checked at the deadline; false if it shows fewer than 3. |
| KKR-20260901-05 | 12% | 2026-09-18 | economic | The Federal Open Market Committee raises the federal funds target range at its September 15-16, 2026 meeting. | Resolves true if the FOMC statement released 2026-09-16 sets the federal funds target range above the range in effect the day before the meeting; false if held or cut. |

## II. REJECTED BY THE GATE — AUDIT TRAIL

Nothing rejected — every projection cleared the gate.

## III. LEDGER STANDING

1220 issued all-time across 14 forecaster arms · 1059 open (99 past deadline — run `python kkr.py --resolve`). **No pooled score is published** — a Brier score belongs to one forecaster; an average across arms is nobody's record.

**This arm — `manual/sonnet-5/unattested`:** 139 issued · 131 open · 8 resolved · 5 hits / 3 misses · **Brier 0.174** against its own base rate 62.5% (climatological 0.234) · **skill +0.257** · under 30 resolved, this is noise.

*13 projection(s) voided — terminated as unadjudicable, never edited; each is itemised with its reason in [the ledger](ledger.html).*

**STANDING BY ARM** — segregated per RPAS 5.04; no pooled figure exists.
