# KAOS KONTROL REPORT — 041719Z NOV 26

**KKR is the Kaos Kontrol Report** — the daily forecasting stage of the Prescient Desk. It reads the open-source collation, elicits falsifiable projections from a named forecaster arm, runs them through a mechanical gate that publishes its rejections with reasons, and seals what survives into the ledger before any outcome exists.

Window: this run · source: battle_report_2026-11-04_1615.md · forecaster: control/trailing · 3 accepted / 0 rejected by validation gate · 0 rated below 35% (base-rate discipline)

## II. REJECTED BY THE GATE — AUDIT TRAIL

Nothing rejected — every projection cleared the gate.

## III. LEDGER STANDING

5335 issued all-time across 22 forecaster arms · 3613 open (1018 past deadline — run `python kkr.py --resolve`). **No pooled score is published** — a Brier score belongs to one forecaster; an average across arms is nobody's record.

**This arm — `control/trailing`:** 75 issued · 75 open · nothing resolved yet — this arm earns a score at its first resolution.

*96 projection(s) voided — terminated as unadjudicable, never edited; each is itemised with its reason in [the ledger](ledger.html).*

**STANDING BY ARM** — segregated per RPAS 5.04; no pooled figure exists.
