# KAOS KONTROL REPORT — 221518Z OCT 26

**KKR is the Kaos Kontrol Report** — the daily forecasting stage of the Prescient Desk. It reads the open-source collation, elicits falsifiable projections from a named forecaster arm, runs them through a mechanical gate that publishes its rejections with reasons, and seals what survives into the ledger before any outcome exists.

Window: this run · source: battle_report_2026-10-22_1513.md · forecaster: lmstudio/qwen36 · 3 accepted / 5 rejected by validation gate · 1 rated below 35% (base-rate discipline)

## I. VALIDATED PROJECTIONS

| id | p | deadline | domain | statement | resolves on |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| KKR-20261022-07 | 15% | 2026-11-12 | disaster | USGS records a magnitude 7.0 or greater earthquake between 2026-11-01 and 2026-11-08 | The USGS Significant Quakes catalog lists an event with a magnitude of 7.0 or greater with a date between 2026-11-01 and 2026-11-08 |

## II. REJECTED BY THE GATE — AUDIT TRAIL

- "CISA KEV adds a new entry with a CVSS score of 10.0 between 2026-10-29 and 2026-11-05" → REJECTED: cited items share no substantive vocabulary with the claim — a citation that does not support its entry makes the 4.02f priors unreadable and forces the keyed/keyless call to default; cite an item that grounds THIS claim
- "WTI Crude closes above 105.00 on any day between 2026-11-02 and 2026-11-06" → REJECTED: cited items share no substantive vocabulary with the claim — a citation that does not support its entry makes the 4.02f priors unreadable and forces the keyed/keyless call to default; cite an item that grounds THIS claim
- "S&P 500 closes below 7,500 on any day between 2026-11-02 and 2026-11-06" → REJECTED: cited items share no substantive vocabulary with the claim — a citation that does not support its entry makes the 4.02f priors unreadable and forces the keyed/keyless call to default; cite an item that grounds THIS claim; resolution names no source of record — a stranger must know exactly where to look on the deadline date
- "Russia conducts a drone attack on Moscow between 2026-11-01 and 2026-11-08" → REJECTED: cited items share no substantive vocabulary with the claim — a citation that does not support its entry makes the 4.02f priors unreadable and forces the keyed/keyless call to default; cite an item that grounds THIS claim
- "Gold closes above 4,200 on any day between 2026-11-02 and 2026-11-06" → REJECTED: cited items share no substantive vocabulary with the claim — a citation that does not support its entry makes the 4.02f priors unreadable and forces the keyed/keyless call to default; cite an item that grounds THIS claim

## III. LEDGER STANDING

4699 issued all-time across 21 forecaster arms · 3347 open (585 past deadline — run `python kkr.py --resolve`). **No pooled score is published** — a Brier score belongs to one forecaster; an average across arms is nobody's record.

**This arm — `lmstudio/qwen36`:** 95 issued · 94 open · 1 resolved · 1 hits / 0 misses · **Brier 0.722** against its own base rate 100.0% (climatological 0.000) · **skill —** · under 30 resolved, this is noise.

*87 projection(s) voided — terminated as unadjudicable, never edited; each is itemised with its reason in [the ledger](ledger.html).*

**STANDING BY ARM** — segregated per RPAS 5.04; no pooled figure exists.
