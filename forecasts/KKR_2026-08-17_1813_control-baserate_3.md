# KAOS KONTROL REPORT — 171813Z AUG 26

**KKR is the Kaos Kontrol Report** — the daily forecasting stage of the Prescient Desk. It reads the open-source collation, elicits falsifiable projections from a named forecaster arm, runs them through a mechanical gate that publishes its rejections with reasons, and seals what survives into the ledger before any outcome exists.

Window: this run · source: battle_report_2026-08-17_1537.md · forecaster: control/baserate · 3 accepted / 5 rejected by validation gate · 2 rated below 35% (base-rate discipline)

## III. LEDGER STANDING

708 issued all-time across 14 forecaster arms · 618 open (5 past deadline — run `python kkr.py --resolve`). **No pooled score is published** — a Brier score belongs to one forecaster; an average across arms is nobody's record.

**This arm — `control/baserate`:** 149 issued · 141 open · 8 resolved · 1 hits / 7 misses · **Brier 0.125** against its own base rate 12.5% (climatological 0.109) · **skill -0.143** · under 30 resolved, this is noise.

*13 projection(s) voided — terminated as unadjudicable, never edited; each is itemised with its reason in [the ledger](ledger.html).*

**STANDING BY ARM** — segregated per RPAS 5.04; no pooled figure exists.
