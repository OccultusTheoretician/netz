# KAOS KONTROL REPORT — 291515Z OCT 26

**KKR is the Kaos Kontrol Report** — the daily forecasting stage of the Prescient Desk. It reads the open-source collation, elicits falsifiable projections from a named forecaster arm, runs them through a mechanical gate that publishes its rejections with reasons, and seals what survives into the ledger before any outcome exists.

Window: this run · source: battle_report_2026-10-29_1513.md · forecaster: lmstudio/qwen36 · 5 accepted / 5 rejected by validation gate · 3 rated below 35% (base-rate discipline)

## II. REJECTED BY THE GATE — AUDIT TRAIL

- "The CISA KEV catalog carries a date-added value for a new CVE between 2026-11-01 and 2026-11-04" → REJECTED: cited items share no substantive vocabulary with the claim — a citation that does not support its entry makes the 4.02f priors unreadable and forces the keyed/keyless call to default; cite an item that grounds THIS claim
- "A new CVE is added to the CISA KEV catalog with a date-added value between 2026-11-08 and 2026-11-11" → REJECTED: cited items share no substantive vocabulary with the claim — a citation that does not support its entry makes the 4.02f priors unreadable and forces the keyed/keyless call to default; cite an item that grounds THIS claim
- "A new CVE is added to the CISA KEV catalog with a date-added value between 2026-11-15 and 2026-11-18" → REJECTED: cited items share no substantive vocabulary with the claim — a citation that does not support its entry makes the 4.02f priors unreadable and forces the keyed/keyless call to default; cite an item that grounds THIS claim
- "A new CVE is added to the CISA KEV catalog with a date-added value between 2026-11-22 and 2026-11-25" → REJECTED: cited items share no substantive vocabulary with the claim — a citation that does not support its entry makes the 4.02f priors unreadable and forces the keyed/keyless call to default; cite an item that grounds THIS claim
- "A new CVE is added to the CISA KEV catalog with a date-added value between 2026-11-29 and 2026-12-02" → REJECTED: cited items share no substantive vocabulary with the claim — a citation that does not support its entry makes the 4.02f priors unreadable and forces the keyed/keyless call to default; cite an item that grounds THIS claim

## III. LEDGER STANDING

5118 issued all-time across 22 forecaster arms · 3396 open (553 past deadline — run `python kkr.py --resolve`). **No pooled score is published** — a Brier score belongs to one forecaster; an average across arms is nobody's record.

**This arm — `lmstudio/qwen36`:** 137 issued · 120 open · 11 resolved · 4 hits / 7 misses · **Brier 0.227** against its own base rate 36.4% (climatological 0.231) · **skill +0.020** · under 30 resolved, this is noise.

*96 projection(s) voided — terminated as unadjudicable, never edited; each is itemised with its reason in [the ledger](ledger.html).*

**STANDING BY ARM** — segregated per RPAS 5.04; no pooled figure exists.
